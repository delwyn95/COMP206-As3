# COMP206-As3

1) prog1.c

Takes an reads an input text file. and based on the number entered, the program calculates the fibonacci sequence respectively.

2) prog2.c

implementing the functions of strncpy,strncat and strncmp.

3) prog3.c

prog3.c that takes 2 positive integers, x and y from the command line and 
creates 2 child processes using fork(), waits for the two child processes to complete, and then terminates. 
The first process sorts x random integers using any sorting algorithm and the second process 
computes the y-th Fibonacci number F(y) using recursion.
